# Data Analysis and Interpretation (DAI) Project
#### Duration: September'21 to November'21
A group project analyzing and interpreting data consisting of 4 million observations of high energy (Center of Mass Energy ∼13 Tev) proton-proton collisions 
generated using PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator. We have studied the relationship between net-charge fluctuation and multiplicity by plotting μ (mean),
σ (std deviation) and σ/μ of net-charge fluctuations using ROOT - Cern data analysis software.
##### Relavent Skills: Theoretical understanding of Data Analysis and Statistics, C++ Programming

#### Group Members:
Bhavna, Devashish, Gopal, Lokesh, Reet, Rupansh, Tarak, Sayali

Comment: I have uploaded the project report which contains link to a github repo with all out codes.
