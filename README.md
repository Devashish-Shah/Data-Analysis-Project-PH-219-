# Data Analysis and Interpretation (DAI) Project
#### Duration: September'21 to November'21
Analyzed and interpreted data consisting of 4 million observations of high energy (Center of Mass Energy ∼13 Tev) proton-proton collisions 
generated using PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator. We have studied the relationship between net-charge fluctuation and multiplicity by plotting μ (mean),
σ (std deviation), and σ/μ of net-charge fluctuations using ROOT - Cern data analysis software.
##### Relevant Skills: Theoretical understanding of Data Analysis and Statistics, C++ Programming

#### Group Members:
Bhavna, Devashish, Gopal, Lokesh, Reet, Rupansh, Tarak, Sayali

Comment: I have uploaded the project report, which contains a link to a GitHub repo with all our codes.
